# Trivia API

This project is a full-stack trivia game where users can test their knowledge answering trivia questions. It is a TDD-based API with the following functionality:

1. Display questions:

   - All questions or by category.
   - Show the question, category, and difficulty.
   - Show/hide the answer.

2. Delete questions.

3. Add new questions with mandatory question and answer texts.

4. Search for questions based on a keyword.

5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Overview

### Tech Stack

Tech stack includes:

- **React.js** and **Sass** for the website's frontend.
- **Python3** and **Flask** as my server-side language and server-side framework.
- **PostgreSQL** as my database of choice.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be my ORM library of choice.

## Getting Started

### Database Configuration

Make sure to have PostgreSQL installed, if it is not, execute:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql
```

#### Create Database

First, start your PostgreSQL database server by running:

```bash
sudo service postgresql start
```

Then, create your project's database by running:

```bash
createdb trivia
```

#### Database Connection String

Add your database connection string as an environment variable by executing:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=<db_connection_string> # e.g. postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database
```

#### Import Database

Make sure to be inside the `/backend` directory. To import the database schema and initial data, run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Installation and Running the Servers

#### Backend

Navigate to the `/backend` directory and make sure that you have **Python3** installed.

##### Create Virtual Environment

Run the following to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate your newly created virtual environment by running:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

##### Installing Backend Dependencies

To install backend dependencies, simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##### Running the Backend Server

Prepare the development environment by executing:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

To run the server at any time, use:

```bash
flask run
```

By default, the Flask server runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

#### Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the `/frontend` directory and make sure that you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed first.

##### Installing Frontend Dependencies

To install backend dependencies, simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

##### Running the Frontend Server

To start the frontend server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will run the React frontend server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

To run the tests, run

```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python3 test_flaskr.py
```

_Omit the `dropdb` command the first time you run tests._
